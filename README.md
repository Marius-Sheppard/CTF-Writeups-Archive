## CTF Writeups by Marius Sheppard

A collection of CTF source files and write-ups that I created.  
Keep in mind that these solutions might not be the best but it's what I came up with during the live competitions. 

In the near future, I'll upload these resources and other write-ups to [my website](https://marius-sheppard.ml) so that everything can be found in one place.
