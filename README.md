## CTF Writeups by Marius Sheppard

A few CTF source files and write-ups that I created in my free time.
Keep in mind that these solutions are intended for beginners and might not be the best/most optimal but what I came up with during the live cyber competitions.


In the near future, I'll upload these resources and other more detailed write-ups to [my website](https://marius-sheppard.ml) so that everything can be found in one place.
This archive doesn't include media (images/videos) but those will be included in the final version of the blog.
